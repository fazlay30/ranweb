    <dt><strong>Defination of Technology (Ruby on rails)</strong></dt>
    <dd>Ruby on rails is a web development framework that gives Rails developers a time saving method for writing code. It is defined as a package library called RubyGem, installed using the command line interface of the operating system. It is a collection of code libraries, which offer a readymate solution for repetitive tasks like developing tables, forms or menus on the website. It is categorized as back-end or server-side web application development platform. The compactness and elegance of the language is the main attraction of it.
    It’s purpose is to support agile development to deliver productivity and flexibility for development teams.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Principles of RoR:</strong></dt>
    <dd>Ruby on Rails is known as an MVC(model-view-controller) full stack framework. The code is separated into 3 interconnected layers:
    * Model contains the logic of an application, all the essential data and high level classes.
    * View is the UI representation of the data present in Model. It’s what users interact with and see on their screens.
    * Controller connects Model and View, receives user inputs, and decides how to handle the input.</dd>

    <h1>The Developer of Ruby</h1>
    <p>Ruby on Rails was developed by David Heinemeier Hansson.</p>

    <h2>How Ruby on Rails was developed and by whom:</h2>
    <p>David Heinemeir Hansson was working on the code base for basecamp back in 2003. Due to complexity of basecamp, he ended up creating a new custom framework in order to build it.
    He used Ruby to create the framework and referred to it as Ruby on Rails. He released that in 2004, but did not share commit rights to the project until February 2005.
    He was fascinated with object-oriented languages. But none that existed at the time appealed to him. Here’s his quote from a past he made back in 1999:<br>
    <br>
    “As a language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a genuine object-oriented, easy to use scripting language. I looked for but couldn’t find one. So I decided to make it.”</p>
  </section>

  <aside>
    <p><strong>Groups that are responsible for managing it:</strong></p>
    <p>Hanson started by himself now with a dedicated  core team he’s progressing. The direction of the framework is being stewarded by the rails core.
    This group manages releases, evaluates pull request, handles conduct complaints, and does a lot of the groundwork on major features. In addition to the core team,
    the committer team assists with processing pull request and making change to the framework. But doesn’t have the key to make final releases or set policy.
    On top of these formal teams, there are thousands of code contributors. More than 6000 people already have contributed.</p>

    <dt>The Growth and expected future of RoR:</dt>
    <dd><p class="ror-para">RoR wasn’t just an enhanced version of Ruby. It was nothing, sort of revolution in the programming world. As Tim O’Reilly of O’Reilly Media publishing house put it at the time:
    “Ruby on Rails is a breakthrough in lowering the barriers of entry to programming. Powerful web applications that formerly might have taken weeks or months to develop 
    can be produced in a matter of days.”
    RoR became nothing sort of a significant success nearly overnight. In 2007, the newly released Mac OS X v.10.5, shipped with RoR built-in. This led to a surge in popularity 
    in developer communities worldwide and loads of application shipped with rails underneath. Each year would bring a new release, enhancing the possibilities and making the 
    language more accessible to newcomers. Ruby on rails 6.0 and as the release log would testify, the team shows no sign of slowing down. Ruby on Rails stood at the 12th position 
    in the list of most loved web framework in 2019 and it jumped up a position in 2020 to stand as the 11th most loved web framework.
    Numbers of industries like Retails, Insurance, E-commerce, etc use Ruby on Rails for web development which creates a huge future scope for innovation. Ruby on Rails 
    is also broadly implemented in mobile app development which suggests it becoming a larger sector in development in future.</p><br><br></dd>
